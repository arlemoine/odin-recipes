## Purpose

This project is designed to improve proficiency of my HTML markup abilities and put the things I have learned or reviewed to the test. 

## Objectives

By the end of this project, I expect to have demonstrated the following skills:
* Proper HTML boilerplate markup
* A concise structure outlining recipe choices and an easy-to-follow recipe guide for each recipe
* A website with the ability to properly navigate between links to recipes and back to the main page
