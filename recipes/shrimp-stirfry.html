        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I like serving this saucy dish over cauliflower rice. The leftovers are really good too, so even if I make this dish for just my husband and me, I make the whole thing and save the leftovers for the next day.</p>
        <p>I think that shrimps are amazing. They are versatile and so delicious. I also happen to adore stir-fry recipes.  Not just because of their wonderful flavor - I like the fact that they are so quick and easy, especially if you use a frozen vegetable mix.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Soy sauce</li>
            <li>Cornstarch</li>
            <li>Minced garlic</li>
            <li>Minced ginger</li>
            <li>Red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>Avocado oil</li>
            <li>Raw shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
            <li>Frozen stirfry veggies</li>
            <li>Sesame oil</li>
            <li>Sesame seeds</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the sauce. </strong>Whisk together the soy sauce, cornstarch, garlic, ginger, and red pepper flakes.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the shrimp and vegetables </strong>in the olive oil over medium-high heat for 5-10 minutes. The idea is to cook them until the veggies are tender-crisp and the shrimp are fully cooked. How long this takes will depend on the size of the shrimp and on whether the veggies are fresh or frozen. While cooking the shrimp with the vegetables, cook them just until they are opaque, then proceed with the rest of the recipe. This ensures the shrimp is not overcooked.</li>
            <li><strong>Add the sauce </strong>and cook just until it thickens, for about 1 more minute. Off heat, drizzle the dish with sesame oil, sprinkle it with sesame seeds, and serve.</li>
        </ol>
