        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Philly Cheesesteak is a sandwich made with super thinly sliced ribeye steak, caramelized onion, and provolone cheese. That simple combination is the original classic as made popular on the East Coast. The Philly Cheesesteak has been modified on the West Coast to include bell peppers and mushrooms but a true “Philly” only has steak, onion and cheese served over a roll.</p>
        <p>The key to a great cheesesteak is super thinly sliced pieces of beef. For easier slicing, cover and freeze your steak for 30-40 minutes (freeze a thicker steak for 40 minutes and a thinner steak for 30 minutes). Cut away any excess fat and silver skin (if present) then use a sharp knife to thinly slice against the grain.</p>
